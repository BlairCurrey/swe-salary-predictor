`baseline.ipynb` is a basic proof of concept that utilizes a minimal amount of features from the stack overflow survey response to predict salaries. The purpose is to generate a rough model so that we have something we can use for developing the retraining service and web application which need some model to work.

`baselin-retrainer.ipynb` is a retraining proof of concept that utilizes are minimalistic model from `baseline.ipynb`.

`model.ipynb` is the final jupyter notebook for building the model. I utlized Google Colab to develop this notebook.

`model-1656041268.ipynb` is an older version of this notebook which I saved because it produced the base model used in the final applciation. The revised, newer verions of the notebook (`model.ipynb`) essentially produces the same model, but it cleans up the notebook considerably and has additional text blocks.
