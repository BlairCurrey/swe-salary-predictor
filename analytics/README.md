`baseline.ipynb` is a basic proof of concept that utilizes a minimal amount of features from the stack overflow survey response to predict salaries. The purpose is to generate a rough model so that we have something we can use for developing the retraining service and web application which need some model to work.

`baselin-retrainer.ipynb` is a retraining proof of concept that utilizes are minimalistic model from `baseline.ipynb`.

`model.ipynb` is where I am building the full model that will utilize more features and be used in the final application.
